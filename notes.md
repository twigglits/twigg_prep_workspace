‚úÖ What to Look For:
```
Algorithm Choice: Is the core logic optimal for the problem size?

Loops and Recursion: Any unbounded or nested loops that could be replaced?

Data Structure Usage: Are hashmaps, heaps, queues used where helpful?

Memory Patterns: Holding large lists/dictionaries that aren't needed?
```


üñäÔ∏è Providing Feedback

```
Mention the time/space complexity of the implementation.

Suggest improvements if the algorithm can be more optimal.

Point out where memory is wasted or execution could be faster.
